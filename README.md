# Josephus-permutation
My take on the classic “Josephus permutation” with a little bit of a twist.  It uses a dynamic doubly linked list to solve it by using the node structure to mimic the physical nature of the problem.

When the problem was first presented to me it was with soldiers, the work includes a few intermediary steps like rearranging the list by switching the pointers.
